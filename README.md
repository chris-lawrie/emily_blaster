# Emily Blaster ðŸª¶

I recently finished reading the book [Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow]([url](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomorrow,_and_Tomorrow,_and_Tomorrow)), which I thoroughly enjoyed and highly recommend.

In the book, one of the characters creates a video game called â€˜Emily Blasterâ€™, which is like [space invaders]([url](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders)), but the ship is a quill, and instead of aliens you shoot lines of [Emily Dickinson]([url](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Dickinson)) poems.

The game also requires that you shoot the lines in order, or else you lose!

I thought itâ€™d be fun to try and build this game for real - at the time of writing it is currently a work in progress.
